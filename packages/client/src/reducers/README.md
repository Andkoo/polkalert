### /packages/client/src/reducers

This folder contains Redux reducers.

### Redux

Redux is a state container for JavaScript apps.

### Redux reducers

Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that [actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions) only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

The Redux reducers documentation can be found [here](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers).
