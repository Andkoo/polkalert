### /packages/client/src/constants

This folder contains definitions of Redux action types. Using constants instead of strings is important because making a mistake in a string type will not result in an error, therefore it will be more difficult to debug. Making a mistake in a constant name, on the other hand, will result in an error and will be easier to resolve.
